## Description
This is a list of personal projects, focusing on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. These projects carried out during the study of specialized courses.

### Outstanding Project
#### 1. Predicting Mobile SIM Prices with Deep Learning (Cloud Computing subject)
- Crawling prices SIM data from internet using Selenium tools
- Building and develop LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model on prices SIM data
- Using Streamlit to developed a user interface basic
- Deploy the website on AWS cloud platform
- *Tools Used: Python | Selenium | scikit-learn | Tensorflow | Streamlit | AWS*

#### 2. Intrusion Detection and Alert System using YOLO (Deep Learning subject)
- Data collection and labeling for custom person dataset using CVAT tool
- Using the YOLOv8n model for training and combine with Telegram application to detect and intrusion alert
- *Tools Used: Python | YOLOv8 | ultralytics*

#### 3. Product Recommendation System for Fashion Websit (Recommendation System subject)
- Using collaborative filtering techniques for personalized product suggestions
- Building a website interface and organized data storage using Flask
- *Tools Used: Python | Flask | scikit-learn*

#### 4. Develop a Website for Cervical Cancer Classification (Software Technology Application subject)
- Design and integrated a pre-trained deep learning model for classifying cervical cancer stages as MobileNet-V2, Inception-V3, InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, ResNet101, Xception.
- Developed a basic user interface and integrated the pre-trained model using Streamlit.
- *Tools Used: Python | scikit-learn | Tensorflow | Streamlit*

#### 5. Building a Website Support Labeling for Cervical Cancer (Intership Subject)
- Similar to Project 4, this project also builds a deep learning model for classifying cervical cancer cells. However, in this project, a new tool called Gradio is used to deploy the user interface.
- *Tools Used: Python | scikit-learn | Tensorflow | Gradio*
